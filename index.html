        This document specifies an API that allows web applications to request the
        angular value to which a device with a screen hinge is folded. Under the
        right conditions, and if allowed, the value representing the angle in
        degrees is returned.

        Implementors need to be aware that this specification is extremely
        unstable. <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the
        discussions will find the specification changing out from under them in
        incompatible ways.</strong> Vendors interested in implementing this
        specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation
        phase should <a href="https://github.com/diekus/fold-angle/">

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        New types of mobile devices are appearing that have some sort of folding capabilities around the screen. Hence, 
        when the device folds, it physically forms an angle. The main interest in knowing the fold angle is because there
         are opportunities in responsive design that enable new user experiences.
      </p>
      <p>Among the described "folding" devices, there are mainly two different physical form factors: devices with a single
         flexible screen (seamless), and devices with two screens (with seam). They can both fold around a hinge, and the 
         current specification applies to both types. It should be clarified as well that both seamless and (devices) with seam
         can be of different dimension ranging from mobile and tablets to laptop sizes. It should also be noted that different
         devices will have different default orientations (portrait or landscape), and that the fold might happen in a vertical
         or horizontal way.    
      </p>
      <span class="centered">
        <img src="images/form-factors.svg" height="150px" alt="drawing of different type of foldable devices">
      </span>
      <p>
        From enhancing the usability of a website by avoiding the area of a fold, to enabling innovative use cases for the 
        web, knowing the fold angle can help developers tailor their content to different devices. It can also enable to 
        detect different postures the device might be in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Content can be consumed and browsed even when the device is not flat, in which case the developer might want to
         provide a different layout for it depending on the state of the angle of the fold. Additionally, developers can 
         adapt content depending on various “postures” and potentially also animate some of these transitions. You can 
         refer to a description of use cases.

        initialized when the <a>document</a> is created, otherwise they MUST

        information</a> of the <a>document</a> to initialize them.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a given <a>document</a>, the <a>current posture</a>

      <h2>
        Security and Privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Exposing the screen fold angle can have some privacy implications when it
        comes to privacy and security. Specifically, the angle value could be used
        for browser fingerprinting, in a way that can help fully or partially
        identify individual users. It is up to the implementer to minimize this,
        and some proposed solutions are listed below.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Lowering the resolution of the angle value
      </h3>
      <p>
        Lowering the resolution of the angle MAY lead to reducing the uniqueness
        that the value can have. Nonetheless, if several sites are being displayed
        on the same device, it can be easy to identify that it is the same user,
        even if the value is rounded. As a solution, applying some fuzziness to
        the value itself MAY work.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Applying fuzziness to the angle value
      </h3>
      <p>
        Lowering the resolution of the returned value may not be enough, so fuzzing
        out the value can algo help, in order to report different values. This fuzzy
        offset can help differentiate returned values, minimizing the risk of fingerprinting.
