        This document specifies an API that allows web applications to request the
        angular value to which a device with a screen hinge is folded. Under the
        right conditions, and if allowed, the value representing the angle in
        degrees is returned.

        Implementors need to be aware that this specification is extremely
        unstable. <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the
        discussions will find the specification changing out from under them in

        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        New types of mobile devices are appearing that have some sort of folding capabilities around the screen. Hence, when the device folds, it physically forms an angle. The main interest in knowing the fold angle is because there are opportunities in responsive design that enable new user experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        From enhancing the usability of a website by avoiding the area of a fold, to enabling innovative use cases for the web, knowing the fold angle can help developers tailor their content to different devices. It can also enable to detect different postures the device might in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Content can be consumed and browsed even when the device is not flat, in which case the developer might want to provide a different layout for it depending on the state of the angle of the fold. We propose a way to expose information about the fold angle of the device to the developer. Additionally, developers would like to adopt content depending on the various modes and potentially also animate some of these transitions. You can refer to a description of use cases.

      <ol>
        <li>A <dfn data-export="">screen wake lock</dfn> prevents the screen

        Concepts and state record
      </h3>
      <p>
        The term <dfn>platform wake lock</dfn> refers to platform interfaces
        with which the user agent interacts to query state and acquire and
        release a wake lock.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>platform wake lock</a> can be defined by the underlying platform
        (e.g. in a native wake lock framework) or by the user agent, if it has
        direct hardware control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each <a>platform wake lock</a> (one per <a>wake lock type</a>) has an
        associated <dfn>state record</dfn> per [=environment settings object /
        responsible document=] with the following <a data-cite=

        lock. The lock is considered acquired only when the request to the
        operating system succeeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, the <a>user agent</a> <dfn data-lt=

        The wake lock is <dfn data-lt=

        Whether the wake lock is applicable is a transient condition, e.g. when

      <h2>
        Security and privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Application of a wake lock causes various device components such as
        display or CPU to operate at higher power levels than they otherwise
        would. This can lead to undesirable and potentially dangerous effects
        such as excessive heating and faster than normal battery charge
        depletion. The latter is particularly relevant to mobile devices which
        may not have a stationary power source readily available. Complete
        battery depletion at an unexpected time can lead to inability of the
        user to make or receive calls and use network services, including the
        emergency call service. Implementations should consider preventing wake
        lock application if they determine that the remaining battery capacity
        is low.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the <a>user agent</a> does not <a>acquire wake lock</a> even
        though a browsing context has requested it, this can be observed by the
        browsing context and can possibly disclose sensitive information about
        the state of the device such as that battery level is low.

        Examples
      </h2>
      <pre class="example js" title="Acquires and releases a screen wake lock">
        function tryKeepScreenAlive(minutes) {
          navigator.wakeLock.request("screen").then(lock =&gt; {
            setTimeout(() =&gt; lock.release(), minutes * 60 * 1000);
          });
        }

        tryKeepScreenAlive(10);
      </pre>
      <p>
        This example allows the user to request a screen wake lock by clicking
        on a checkbox, but updates the checkbox checked state in case the wake
        lock state changes:
      </p>
      <pre class="example js" id="onrelease-example">
        const checkbox = document.createElement("input");
        checkbox.setAttribute("type", "checkbox");
        document.body.appendChild(checkbox);

        const sentinel = await navigator.wakeLock.request("screen");
        checkbox.checked = true;
        sentinel.onrelease = () =&gt; checkbox.checked = false;
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this example, two different wake lock requests are created and
        released independently:
      </p>
      <pre class="example js">
        let lock1 = await navigator.wakeLock.request("screen");
        let lock2 = await navigator.wakeLock.request("screen");

        lock1.release();
        lock2.release();
